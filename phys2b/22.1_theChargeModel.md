### Terms
|Term|def.|
|---|---|
|discharging|removing charge from an object. done by touching a charged object|
|conductors|materials through or along which charge easily moves|
|insulators|materials on or in which charges remain immobile|
|positively charged|a glass rod that has been rubbed with a silk is positively charged|
|negatively charged|any charged object that attracts a charged glass rod is negatively charged|
|fundamental unit of charge|Fundamental unit fo charge, symbol: $e$|
|electrically neutral|An objectiwth an equal number of protons and electrons has no net charge (q=0)|
|charge quantization|the amount of chrage on an object varies by small but discrete steps, not continuously|
|ionization|the process of removing an electron from the electron cloud of an atom|
|law of conservation of charge|charge is neither created nor destroyed|
|current|the charges that physically move are called the charge carriers|
|charge polarization|a slight separation of the postiive and negative charges in a neutral object|
|polarization force|the net force towards the charged rod|
