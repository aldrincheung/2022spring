Proposed Topics
- What are the methods used to generate randomness in modern comptuers?
- What are the challenges in this endeavor, and how can these challenges be overcome?
- How can we generate randomness according to a givenproabiltiy distribution?
- How does one verify that a random number generator indeed rpodeces random numbers?
- Why do we need random number generation?
- How is randomness used in statistical analysis and/or in computer simulation?
- How is randomness used in cryptography?



Usage for random number generation
- uniformly select representative data
- "data" generation
- decide on arbitrary starting point 
- an alternative to linear options
- testing -> deterministic random number generation
- encryption
